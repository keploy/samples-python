# Flask + SQLite Sample App with Keploy Integration

This is a simple **Student Management REST API** built using Python's Flask framework and SQLite for storage. It demonstrates basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and showcases how to write **API tests with [Keploy](https://keploy.io)** by auto-capturing HTTP calls as test cases.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧑 Add, retrieve, update, and delete students
- 💾 Uses SQLite — no external DB setup required
- 🔌 RESTful API with JSON input/output
- ✅ Auto-generate test cases using [Keploy CLI](https://docs.keploy.io)
- 🔄 Replay & validate API responses with Keploy

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Flask** — Lightweight web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** — ORM for SQLite
- **SQLite** — Built-in relational DB
- **Keploy** — Testing toolkit for API auto-mocking and regression testing

## API Endpoints

```bash

| Method | Endpoint         | Description          |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| GET    | `/students`      | Get all students     |
| POST   | `/students`      | Add a new student    |
| PUT    | `/students/<id>` | Update student by ID |
| DELETE | `/students/<id>` | Delete student by ID |

```

## Sample Curl Commands

http://localhost:5000/
```json
{
    "message": "Flask Student API"
}
```


### Add a student

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/students \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 21}'
```
# Get all students
curl http://localhost:5000/students



# Update student
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/students/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Alice Updated", "age": 22}'

# Delete student
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/students/1

```

## Running Keploy Tests

Step 1: Record Tests
Start Keploy in record mode:

```bash
keploy record --command "python app.py"
```
Send some API requests via curl or Postman to generate test cases.

Step 2: Replay Tests
After recording, stop the app and run:

```bash
keploy test --command "python app.py"
```
> Keploy will replay the previously captured requests and validate responses.
